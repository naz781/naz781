### Software Engineer
![Design and Development](https://github.com/naz781/naz781/blob/main/Beige%20and%20White%20Modern%20LinkedIn%20Background%20Photo.png)

Frontend engineering and making powerful, intuitive web apps are two of my favorite things to do. Here at BloomTech, where I am a student, we focus heavily on innovation, problem-solving, and coding. My experience as a project manager allows me to see projects through from beginning to end with ease.
